# Dungeon Slayer

A powerful, highly-optimized 2D Action RPG / Dungeon Crawler featuring smooth controls, intense 'Hit-Stop' combat natively built in Unity, and dynamic Anime-styled action mechanics.

## Features
- **Fluid Combat System**: Fast-paced melee combat with 'Hit-Stop' and screen-shake impact juice.
- **Shadow Dash**: Speed-blitz dodging mechanic that leaves behind shadow-step afterimages.
- **Awakening System**: Players can trigger a Limit-Break state increasing their combat capabilities.
- **Dynamic Loot System**: Enemies explode with scattered loot (coins, hearts, powerups) upon death.
- **Optimized Core Architecture**: Runs cleanly with zero frame-drops using an Event-driven Stats system.
